This is a ring mapper algorithm.

Input arguments in the command line are as follows:

"./ring_mapper_analysis <directory of your test file> <number of reads> <i to retrieve> <j to retrieve>"

The directory and the number of reads are required for the program to function.
The last two arguments (i and j) can be omitted if you don't want to retrieve anything.
