# Ring Mapper Analysis

This is a ring mapper algorithm.

Input arguments in the command line are as follows:

"./ring_mapper_analysis directory_of_your_test_file, number_of_reads i_to_retrieve j_to_retrieve"

The directory and the number of reads are required for the program to function.
The last two arguments (i and j) can be omitted if you don't want to retrieve anything.

ring_mapper_results.csv delivers the raw results

ring_mapper_histogram.csv prints a histogram

ring_mapper_retrieval.csv retrieves the data in the specified position

ring_mapper_counter.csv displays the number of mutations in each position

everything else is debugging rubbish
